# Giphy-API-DisneyMovies

## This web app displays GIFs from a Disney movie that the user selects.

## To do this, I used an api from the website of Giphy.  The program is able to dynamically create buttons for previously
## not included Disney movies that the user wants to use to pull up GIFs.  The GIF can be made to be still or to move, based 
## on the user clicking it.  

## To do this project, I used javascript, jQuery, html, and css.

This project is deployed on github pages at https://paulschaller.github.io/Giphy-API-DisneyMovies/


This is how it runs:

This is the initial screen.  There are buttons for ten Disney movies that the user can click to pull up GIFs.

The user clicks on *The Lion King* button.  Ten GIFs then populate the screen.

The user can click on one of the GIFs to set it into motion.  By clicking on the GIF again, the motion will stop.

The user can create a button by putting the name of a Disney movie into the *Add Your Movie* input box.  In this screenshot, 
*Mulan* is input and that button appears in the list of buttons.

The final screenshot shows the GIFs displayed when the dynamically created *Mulan* button is clicked.
